       <p> Greater Prusretic Reich/Großprusretisches Reich is a country located in central Europe, and one of the three global superpowers. The Reich borders the Generalgouvernement, Ukraine and Ostland to the east, Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia to the south, Denmark and the Baltic and North Seas to the north and while to its west the Reich technically borders France, the Ordensstaat Burgund, a de facto independent state unrecognized by the international community and technically part of Germany, is between both nations. The Reich also possesses colonies spanning across Africa, Eurasia and Antarctica, with most of them having separate policies and administration in controlling their respective areas.
              Germany has a history stretching back centuries, but the Greater German Reich itself was formed in 1933 after the National Socialist German Workers Party or the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, took control of the country. After victory in World War II, Germany established the Einheitspakt, a faction designed to reign in the newly established colonies of Europe and Africa. However, following a market crash in 1950 and political infighting amongst the government as the Führer's health deteriorates, the very structure of Germany and the empire it constructed hangs in the balance.
              Germany is a totalitarian one-party state, ruled by the NSDAP and led by Adolf Hitler (although most government duties have been given to other officials). It is the leader of the Einheitspakt and the most powerful state in Europe.
              In-Game Description
              Once humbled by their failures in the Weltkrieg, Germany once more rose to prominence with the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Thanks to the failure of the Allies, WW2 has ended in complete German victory.
              Germany now presides over the most powerful empire on Earth, but despite her victory, Germany's control remains tenuous at best. Wracked by an economic crash that has frozen the nation for a decade, and with a massive slave caste providing for the German people, the population has began to protest. The nation is now wrapped in a series of student protests and the machinations of the Deutche Bank.
